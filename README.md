# Pets Api

This is a sample how quickly setup a Rails Api with tests and documentation automaticaly generated.

## Requirements
In this sample, I used Ruby 2.4.0 and Rails 5.1.4.

## Tests with Rspec for Rails
This sample uses `rspec-rails` gem for running unit tests. 
In order to run tests, you should use `rspec` command at root app dir. 
You can read more about Rspec for Rails here.

This sample uses `rspec-rails` gem for running unit tests. 
In order to generate api documentation, you should use `rake docs:generate` command at root app dir.
